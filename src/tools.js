// Tool catalog + pure query/path builders for redditapis-mcp.
// Kept separate from the server wiring (index.js) so it can be unit-tested
// without spawning the stdio transport.
//
// Each tool maps 1:1 to a REST endpoint at https://api.redditapis.com/api/reddit.
// Tool arg names map 1:1 to endpoint query params, EXCEPT path params written as
// {name}/{id} in a tool's `path` (e.g. /api/reddit/sub/{name}/top), which are
// interpolated into the URL and removed from the query string.
//
// WRITES: reddit writes (comment/vote/DM -- posting AS the customer to Reddit
// itself) are a separate authenticated surface and remain intentionally out of
// scope here, that boundary is unchanged. Monitor/webhook management (2026-08-11,
// task #43) is a DIFFERENT kind of write: it configures the customer's OWN
// redditapis.com account (an alerting subscription), the same risk class as
// reading their own usage -- it never posts, votes, or DMs anywhere. Those tools
// are marked `write: true` (and `destructive: true` for remove/delete), which
// index.js turns into MCP's `readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint` annotations so a
// client can surface a confirmation before calling them.
//
// BODY-BEARING TOOLS: a POST tool's args become a JSON request body instead of
// a query string (see buildBody below). `filterSpecFields` on a tool declares
// which of its args nest under `filter_spec` in that body; everything else in
// `shape` stays top-level (id, cadence_s, active, url, kind, ...).
//
// LOCAL TOOLS (2026-09-04): a tool carrying `local: "<handler>"` is dispatched
// by index.js to a handler in this package instead of straight to the API.
// Args flagged in `localArgs` are consumed locally and never sent. Today the
// only such tool is reddit_feedback_send, whose draft queue lives on disk in
// src/feedback.js and whose POST to /feedback happens only on the user's say.
// index.js refuses to boot if a catalog entry names a handler it lacks, so a
// `local` tag can never turn into a silent passthrough with the local args
// attached.
//
// PUBLIC MOUNTS: every tool path is under /api/reddit/ EXCEPT the feedback
// pair, which the API serves un-prefixed (api.redditapis.com/feedback) because
// it is mounted outside the metered /api surface, like /account. The catalog
// test pins the allowed prefixes so a typo cannot invent a third one.

A stale withhold is the usual reason a monitor's delivered count sits far below its matched count with no error anywhere; it is the freshness gate working as intended, not a failure or a plan limit, and retrying cannot recover the items. `ceiling_reached` is the field that indicates the daily cap was hit, and a stale withhold does not set it. When `suppressed_breakdown.resolved` is false the split does not add up to the total and `unresolved_reason` says why; `ceiling_reached` stays conservative in that case rather than being cleared. THOSE COUNTS COVER ONLY POSTS THAT WERE FETCHED. A post that was not fetched was not matched and leaves no row behind, so it is absent from all three counters; zeros there mean no matches were recorded, not that nothing was missed. `coverage_24h` is the separate field that speaks to fetching. Its `status` is `complete` (every poll reached the point where the previous poll finished), `degraded` (at least one poll was truncated and posts were lost unrecoverably; see `gaps[]`, `posts_in_window_at_least` and the estimated `posts_missed_estimate`), `partial` (nothing found, but not every kind of loss was checked; see `unobserved_events`), or `unknown` (the check could not be run at all; see `reason`). `unknown`, `partial` and a null count each mean the question went unanswered. `coverage_24h` is fed by the poll log and covers BOTH ways a poll loses posts unrecoverably (`listing_exhausted`, where Reddit stopped serving older posts, and `poll_overflow`, where the feed outran one poll's page budget); `observed_events` names what was actually checked, and a status of `complete` is awarded only when both were. WHAT `complete` ESTABLISHES: every poll that RAN got back to where the previous poll finished, AND every feed was actually polled. The second half comes from `stream_liveness`. A feed that is not polled writes nothing to the poll log, so on the poll log alone it looks identical to a healthy monitor; `stream_liveness` reads a different source (the polling registry plus the per-feed last-successful-poll stamp), neither of which a poll that did not run can produce. Its `status` is `live` (every feed checked within three times its own interval), `degraded` (at least one is not: `streams[]` marks each feed `never_polled`, `stalled` or `unregistered`), or `unknown` (could not be established, including `streams_awaiting_first_poll` on a monitor created moments ago, which clears itself). `coverage_24h` reads `complete` only while `stream_liveness` is `live`. A zero delivery count on a `never_polled` feed means nothing was checked, not a quiet subreddit. `gaps[]` IS A SAMPLE, NOT THE WHOLE LIST: it carries the most recent gaps only, `gaps_returned` says how many are in it, `gaps_truncated` says whether more exist, and `gap_events_24h` is the true total. `cadence` reports whether the monitor is served the interval its plan sells, which none of the fields above can. `promised_cadence_s` is the floor the account's CURRENT plan includes and `requested_cadence_s` is what this monitor is actually set to; `meets_entitlement` false means the monitor is set slower than the plan allows, which happens because a plan upgrade does not re-cadence monitors that already exist (setting `cadence_s` on the monitor changes it, and a deliberately slower cadence is also a legitimate choice). `last_checked_s_ago`, `freshness_ratio` and `within_margin` describe the slowest feed feeding this monitor, named in `slowest_stream`; `freshness_reading` marks them as ONE INSTANTANEOUS SAMPLE, not an average and not a sustained verdict, so a single reading past the margin is not by itself proof of under-service. These fields are TRI-STATE: a null `within_margin` or `meets_entitlement` means the question could not be answered, and `unknown_reason` says why.",
