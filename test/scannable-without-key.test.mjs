/**
 * A REGISTRY SCANNER MUST BE ABLE TO ENUMERATE OUR TOOLS WITH NO CREDENTIALS.
 *
 * Self-running, like the other tests here: `node test/scannable-without-key.test.mjs`.
 * Spawns the real server as a scanner would, over real stdio, with a DELIBERATELY
 * EMPTY env. Nothing here is mocked, because the regression being guarded against
 * is a process that exits before it can answer, and a mock cannot exit.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. src/index.js used to `process.exit(1)` when REDDITAPIS_KEY was
 * unset. tools/list is the DISCOVERY step in the MCP spec, ahead of tool selection
 * and any invocation, so a scanner calls it before it could possibly hold a key,
 * and it got nothing.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-06 against the published package by speaking raw MCP stdio
 * with an empty env: redditapis-mcp@0.5.2 answered neither initialize nor
 * tools/list. A directory that spawns the server to enumerate its catalog gets
 * an initialization failure, not a server with zero tools.
