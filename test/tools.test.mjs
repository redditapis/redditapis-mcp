// Catalog size is a RATCHET, not a fixed number. `assert.equal(TOOLS.length, N)`

// of an assertion nobody believes. The regression actually worth catching is the
// opposite direction: a tool silently DISAPPEARING from the catalog while every
// other test still passes, because each remaining tool is individually well-formed.
//
// Two checks cover that without punishing growth:
//   1. A floor. Adding a tool always passes. Removing one fails. Raise
//      CATALOG_FLOOR deliberately when you want to lock in new ground.
//   2. Parity against the shipped README's tool table: every tool documented
//      there must still exist by name, so a deletion fails and NAMES the tool
//      rather than reporting an off-by-one integer.
//
// Direction matters: this runs README -> catalog, never the reverse. The catalog
// deliberately carries tools the README table does not list (the cookie-
// authenticated user-history reads, which need a REST login step that is not
// itself an MCP tool), so requiring the reverse would fail on a documented-by-
// design omission. tools.js is the source of truth; the README is the published
// promise, and this asserts we have not broken a promise we already shipped.
//
// WHAT THIS STILL CANNOT SEE, stated plainly so nobody reads a green here as
// more than it is: removing an UNDOCUMENTED tool while adding any other tool in
// the same change keeps the length at or above the floor and leaves every
// README-documented name present, so both checks pass. The four cookie-
// authenticated user-history reads are the tools in that gap. Closing it needs a
// name-by-name manifest, which is the hand-maintained list this replaced, so the
// trade is deliberate rather than an oversight.
//
// IF YOU ADDED A TOOL: nothing here fails, and nothing needs editing. Bump
